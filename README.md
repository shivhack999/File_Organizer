# File-Organizer
A file organizer is a tool that helps users manage and organize their files in a specified directory.
File organizers can be programmed to automatically sort files based on criteria such as file type, date modified, or file name.
File organizers can help users save time and effort in manually organizing their files, and can ensure that important files are easy to find and access when needed.
Node.js is a platform that can be used to create a file organizer, providing a framework for developing server-side applications in JavaScript.
A file organizer created using Node.js can be customized to meet specific needs and preferences, and can be run locally on a computer or deployed to a server.
